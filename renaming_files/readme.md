# Install
`pip install pandas np`

## To run
`python renaming_files.py`

Code will read files in `folder` directory, if they match the document path column in the `example.xlsx` folder it will pull the document number and document title from the row, and create a new name based on this and copy the files to a new folder called `output`.
